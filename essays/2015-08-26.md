I’ve always wanted to work with computers, but who knew that there’d be so much math involved? Not me!

Math has never been my strong suit and unfortunately, it seems like I’ll be needing a lot of it, so I know that that’s an area that I’ll need to put more time into to ensure that I can progress with this major as smoothly and efficiently as possible.

As a game enthusiast, I naturally have a special interest in learning how to develop video games, but more specifically the AI within it. I hope that I’ll be able to enroll in classes that go into more depth regarding this topic. 

In the future, I look forward to working with other people in a team environment to create a large-scale program for the masses. I’m interested in how large companies manage team dynamics and roles for projects.
