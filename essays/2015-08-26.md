I’ve always loved working with computers. I’ve always been interested in how it works and what I could get it to do. Being able to study and learn about computers and have it being taught by someone with the same passion for computers that I have has been an absolute game changer. 

The hardest part about my journey so far has been deciding between a hardware or software path. I started off by taking two courses, one of each. I really enjoyed building and fixing computers in my CENT class, but I loved Java more. 

After taking 3 semesters learning to code I decided to go the programming route, but who knew that there’d be so much math involved? Not me!

Math has never been my strong suit and unfortunately, it seems like I’ll be needing a lot of it, so I know that that’s an area that I’ll need to put more time into to ensure that I can progress with this major as smoothly and efficiently as possible. 



As a game enthusiast, I naturally have a special interest in learning how to develop video games, but more specifically the AI within it. I hope that I’ll be able to enroll in classes that go into more depth regarding this topic. 

In the future, I also look forward to working with other people in a team environment to create a large-scale program for the masses. I’m interested in how large companies manage team dynamics and roles for such projects.
