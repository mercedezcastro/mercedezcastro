Floor2Ceiling is a website that I created in the Summer of 2018 during my spare time for my father's local construction business. I started this project to help me learn how to design a website using HTML and CSS.

I began this project with only basic knowledge of self-taught HTML and CSS. Everything that I learned about building this website is from various YouTube tutorials. I first started with videos to refresh myself with the basics of HTML. Eventually, I stumbled across videos on CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid. 

CSS Grid immediately sparked my interest in how simple and unique the code was. I also decided to use Grid to build this website because it was more recent than flexbox and I wanted to familiarize myself with the code. The outcome is a simple informative website with links to showcase different areas of renovation, most recent projects, and a contact form. 

In this project I gained useful experience with responsive web design, HTML, and CSS + Grid.
