Floor2Ceiling is a website that I created in the Summer of 2018 during my spare time for my father's local consturction business. I started this project to help me learn how to design a website using HTML and CSS.

I began this project with only basic knowledge of self-taught HTML and CSS. Everything that I learned about building this website is from various YouTube tutorials. I first started with videos to refresh myself of the basics of HTML and CSS and eventually learned how to use CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid. I decided to use CSS Grid to build this website because it was more recent and interesting and I wanted to try the code out for myself. The outcome is a simple informative website with links to showcase different areas of renovation, most recent projects, and a contact form. 

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
