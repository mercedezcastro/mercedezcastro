summary: A card game that I developed for ICS 211.
---

In ICS 111, I used Java to create a terminal based game of Blackjack. I was the sole developer and I learned how to create and implement numerous class files for creating a deck of cards and each card with their corresponding suit.

The game would start off by dealing you two random cards by using the Math.random() method. The game would continue on as normal by asking you if you wanted to ‘Hit’ or ‘Stand’. The loop would continue unless the user chose to stand. If the player didn’t exceed 21, then the dealer would get dealt two random cards by the same method. The winner would be chosen according to the normal rules of the game and you could choose to replay the game or not before the program would end. If the user chose to replay the game, the program would continue dealing the remaining deck of cards that weren’t used.

I can still recall how much fun and ‘aha!’ moments that I had programing this game, and I can still remember how proud I felt submitting the code for my first ‘real’ program.
